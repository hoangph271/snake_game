## snake_game

A simple PoC `snake_game` poorly written in Rust.  
Rendering was done with `piston`.

`// TODO:`
- [ ] `food` for `snake`
- [ ] remove blocking `rodio`
- [ ] package audio files with the binary
- [ ] BUG: `snake` is now un-killable
- [x] `snake` consumes `food`
- [x] spawn `food`
- [x] background music, with [rodio](https://docs.rs/rodio)
